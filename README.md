# Tokens & Rails

It is just a little program for fun, with tokens, following rails, affected by physics, all of this with HTML5 canvas and JavaScript.

## Implementation

* Token display - 100%
I may add some colors, or personnalization some day.
  * Line path - 100%
  * Circle path - 60%
* Path display - 80%
Not enough beautiful for you? I think they are not.
* Token following path - 80%
* Token gravity - 80%
* Token friction - 100%
* Token collision - 0%
I still don't know which method I will use.
* Token movable by user - 0%
